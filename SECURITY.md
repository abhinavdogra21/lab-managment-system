# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The LNMIIT Lab Management System now implements secure password handling to prevent default password vulnerabilities.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. No Default Passwords for New Users
- ✅ New HOD users created automatically when departments are added have NO password
- ✅ Users must set their password via the forgot password flow
- ✅ Prevents credential stuffing and default password attacks

### 2. Automatic HOD User Creation
- ✅ When a new department is created, an HOD user is automatically generated
- ✅ Email format: `hod.{department_code}@lnmiit.ac.in`
- ✅ No password set initially - user must reset via forgot password flow

### 3. Enhanced Login Security
- ✅ Login form detects users without passwords
- ✅ Automatically guides users to forgot password page
- ✅ Clear messaging about password setup requirement

## Current Testing Configuration

For testing purposes, all existing users have password: **"123"**

You can login with any of these credentials:
- `hod.cse@lnmiit.ac.in` / `123`
- `admin@lnmiit.ac.in` / `123`
- Any other user email / `123`

## Production Security Setup

When ready for production, run this command to implement full security:

```bash
node secure-password-policy.js
```

This will:
- Keep admin accounts with passwords for system access
- Remove passwords from all HOD accounts
- Remove passwords from faculty, lab_staff, student accounts
- Force users to set passwords via forgot password flow

## Security Benefits

1. **No Default Passwords**: Eliminates risk of default credential attacks
2. **Email Verification**: Users must access their email to set passwords
3. **User-Controlled Passwords**: Users choose their own secure passwords
4. **Audit Trail**: Password resets are logged and traceable

## User Workflow

1. User visits login page
2. Enters email and role
3. If no password set, system redirects to forgot password
4. User receives reset email
5. User clicks link and sets secure password
6. User can now login normally

## Files Modified

- `lib/database.ts` - Updated HOD creation logic
- `components/auth/login-form.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Password validation logic
- `app/api/admin/departments/ensure-hods/route.ts` - Maintenance endpoint

## Maintenance Commands

- `node secure-password-policy.js` - Implement full security (remove all passwords)
- `/api/admin/departments/ensure-hods` - API to create missing HOD users

**Current Status**: Testing mode with password "123" for all users
**Production Ready**: Run secure-password-policy.js to enable full security
